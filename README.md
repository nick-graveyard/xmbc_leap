xbmc-leap
=========


This is a Python addon for Xbox media center to connect the Leap motion. 

This was a class project in a human computer interaction course.

Leap motion has a REST/JSON api for controlling it.

I used the python bindings for leap motion and made the REST API calls upon gesture recognition.

I made an addon portion of the program to try to integrate some custom graphics inside of xbmc which is still buggy due to the XBMC doc's being very rough and the XBMC python api changing rapidly with each XBMC version change.
